## About the developer

Hey there! My name is Chelsea Quindipan and I am a recent graduate from BrainStation's Software Engineering Program. I first became interested in coding because I wanted to build my own portfolio as a Freelance Graphic Designer. This interest in coding eventually lead me to make a career shift to become a Full Stack Software Developer!
